# Meeting Notes (August 27th)

### Robot Design Finalization

This is the latest robot design. It is much more compact than the previous design. Also, the arm motors are closer to the ground. This is because most of the missions on this year's mat are on/close to the ground as well.

As a team, we will decide either to finalize this design or choose a different design idea.

### Essential MyBlocks

Each team member will be assigned at least one basic essential MyBlock. Here are some examples of essential MyBlocks. The three (six*) assigned MyBlocks are bolded.

- **Move forward/backward with the gyro sensor**
- **Turn in place with the gyro sensor**
- Turn forward/backward with the gyro sensor
- Turn in place to a set gyro angle
- Turn forward/backward to a set gyro angle
- **Move an arm**
- Move an arm to a set position
- Line follow (advanced)

\* *Each of the assigned MyBlocks will be split into two (e.g. `turn in place` becomes `turn left in place` and `turn right in place`).*

Your assignment, including your MyBlock and details, is in [the Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com/w/NjA5NDQ5OTEyOTg5/tc/NjE5Njc0NDcyNjkx).

### Homework

1. Memorize all the missions. You should know each model's name and scoring details.
2. Make your assigned MyBlock. You can view your MyBlock in your [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com/w/NjA5NDQ5OTEyOTg5/tc/NjE5Njc0NDcyNjkx) assignment.
